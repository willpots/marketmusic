#Final Project Writeup

##Will Potter

Team marketmusic had a great time and built an exciting new experiment to randomly generate music based on the performance of publicly traded stocks. The application (willpots.github.io/marketmusic) allows a user to choose a stock by its ticker symbol and then play the generator. The generator will plot a graph of the price while also playing the music to accompany the graph. We used new HTML5 features, such as the Web Audio API and canvas while also using 3rd party libraries like jQuery and oCanvas. On the team, Mike headed up the musical development, by determining the patterns to play and programming the web audio API. Hunter and Cayla researched similar products online and came up with the interface for the project. I wrote the functionality to pull data from Yahoo's finance API, while also writing a good bit of the connecting logic to tie Hunter, Cayla and Mike's code together. Overall, the project was fun, enjoyable and challenging.
